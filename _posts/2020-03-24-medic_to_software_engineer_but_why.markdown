During my time in the Army as a Medic I had the honor to not only be a part of something bigger than myself but it also exposed me to all types of stressful situations where critical/creative thinking was necessary to accomplish the mission at hand. From performing life saving interventions to coming up with a plan on the spot to get the patient from the point of injury to safety. Situations like these had several variables to consider during the process with little room for error. Although helping people in need drove me to push past certain obstacles, the thinking process and problem solving is what drove me to continue to optimize my process and get better as a whole. 	
 
 Now you may be asking, well how does this relate to coding at all? Well as a Line Medic you had to review vital trends, wounds, etc and see how the body was responding and execute interventions to counteract the bodyâ€™s failing attempt to sustain life and lead it in the right direction to stabilization. This is how I see coding as well. You have a goal/problem, error codes are the vitals and broken lines of code are the wounds. You see the error codes that lead you to the broken code and you perform interventions to keep the program running smoothly. A little less at stake in these situations but still triggers the same urgency and thinking process which just drives me to know more and become better at what I do.

The deeper I get into this career path, the more I love it. I chose to become a Software Engineer so I could continue doing something I love for a living. I look forward to continuing down this path and I thank Flatiron schools for giving me the opportunity to pursue my chosen career path.
